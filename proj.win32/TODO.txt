Gameplay:
-There will be a median in the road so you can take a break
-possibly have pedestrians
-definitely have vehicles
-maybe crosswalks/stoplights can be worked in
-swipe in any direction to make chicken move
-accelerometer in any way?
-stopwatches to slow time?

-the background image has 16 'lanes'.  Divide the height by 16 to get the amount the chicken should move up

NOTES:
I tried creating a vector that will hold Vehicles.  Vehicles each contain a CCSprite.  When trying to add these Sprites
to the GameScene in the update method, I would get a crash at CCNode.cpp line 507.  Here are some explanations of the
problem:

So, to solve this, I can learn how to use retain and release, and continue to use my design.
Or, another option MIGHT be to subclass CCSprite for all of the vehicles (rather than composing them).  This would allow
me to add the Vehicles to a CCArray.  In reality, this would probably be easier.
Which design should I do?
