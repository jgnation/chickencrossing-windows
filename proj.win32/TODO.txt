Chicken Crossing
-Purpose: The purpose of the game is to get the chicken from one side of the road to the other.
Mission, should you choose to accept it: get to the other side!

Features:
-Timed mode
-Keep playing until you die
-Compete against self
-gain points with items to pickup?
-pick up items to eliminate traffic
-swipe option or buttons on screen option


Gameplay:
-There will be a median in the road so you can take a break
-possibly have pedestrians
-definitely have vehicles
-maybe crosswalks/stoplights can be worked in
-swipe in any direction to make chicken move
-accelerometer in any way?
-stopwatches to slow time?
-bridges and jumping fish?  cart and horses?
-collect a number of eggs before crossing the road.  an egg will only appear after others are collected.
-when five chickens get across, increase the level.
-I need to figure out how many vertical lanes there will be
-chicken can get to five spots at the end.  When he does progress to next level and increase difficulty.



Notes:
-don't forget to release() and/or delete all of the objects that are created that are not being managed by the cocos2d-x memory pool!

TODO:
-fix bug that occurs when a chicken dies while riding a log
-refactor and clean up code!
-put alligators in the water
-add a chicken count...game over if reach 0
-make dimensions easier to reference
-try out stuff on various screen sizes
-change level after collecting a certain number of eggs
-new levels mean more traffic and more eggs
-new Scenes for each level?
-I can't think of a way to add more challenge and fun without a river....dang it!
-scale vehicle sprites better
-the _currentPosition section in Chicken is causing problems.  It needs to get updated along with the sprite's position.
	-the only reason it exists currently is so I can update the position with the moveUp(), moveLeft(), etc functions BEFORE running the animation.
	-instead....it would be better if the moveUp(), moveLeft(), etc functions actually ran the animations, rather than the game layer.
	-or...maybe Chicken should extend CCSprite

EVENTUALLY:
-make more level maps....some with stuff to jump onto

TODO BUGS:


FIXED BUGS:
-fix the bug where if an egg is at the left side of the screen, the chicken dies
-sometimes the cars are flipped the wrong way
