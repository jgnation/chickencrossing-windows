-In that game, vehicles spawn at predictable intervals.  Each lane has certain vehicle(s) that spawn, but in
no particular order.  It appears to be random (unless it is the same thing every time)
-so it looks like each lane has a list of possibilities, and an item from those possibilities is picked at random

Chicken Crossing
-Purpose: The purpose of the game is to get the chicken from one side of the road to the other.
Mission, should you choose to accept it: get to the other side!

Features:
-Timed mode
-Keep playing until you die
-Compete against self
-gain points with items to pickup?
-pick up items to eliminate traffic
-swipe option or buttons on screen option


Gameplay:
-There will be a median in the road so you can take a break
-possibly have pedestrians
-definitely have vehicles
-maybe crosswalks/stoplights can be worked in
-swipe in any direction to make chicken move
-accelerometer in any way?
-stopwatches to slow time?
-bridges and jumping fish?  cart and horses?
-collect a number of eggs before crossing the road.  an egg will only appear after others are collected.
-when five chickens get across, increase the level.
-I need to figure out how many vertical lanes there will be
-chicken can get to five spots at the end.  When he does progress to next level and increase difficulty.

Notes:
-don't forget to release() and/or delete all of the objects that are created that are not being managed by the cocos2d-x memory pool!


options for refactoring vehicle spawning:
-vehicles can inherit from CCSprite.  then the CCObject * sender can be that sprite and I can easily remove it
-

+I need to maintain a list of sprites currently on the screen.  I can precreate them like I am now (this is a waste if
many of them are not on the screen), or I can create them on the fly (waste of time constantly initializing)
+If I precreate them, I can add a 'isVisible' property to check.  if !isVisible, don't execute any logic
+If I precreate them, where would I do it?  In GameLayer?  In each Lane?  The lane can only produce certain vehicles.
+Each lane could precreate vehicles, have a list of them, and pick them at random to display them
+If I were to do that, I would have to somehow notate which ones are currently visible
+CCSprite has a isVisible property
+If I create them on the fly, I can:
	-create them in lane
	-add the sprite to the layer
	-after adding the sprite, add the vehicle to a list of vehicles....isVisible will be true
	-in the callback, isVisible will be false after removing it from the layer (either that or I will set it to false)
	-in the update method I can scan the list of vehicles.  Vehicles where !isVisible, delete it
+Ideally I want the object destroyed right when the action is over!
+Maybe initiate the action in the Vehicle class...with the callback in the Vehicle class.  Then the callback can call a 
'delete this'?  Maybe?  I SHOULD TRY THIS FIRST.
+I Think the option directly above would work well....but it is not optimal.  The best thing to do will probably be to
have Vehicle inherit from CCSprite and have the callback remove it.  I would have to redo sprite intersection logic...
although that may already be built into CCSprite
+Really...the best way would probably be to NOT create these sprite dynamically.  Use the isVisible property.  I would
just have to make sure that we never try to add a sprite that is already doing something on the screen.
+Maybe SpriteContainer should be a CCNode instead of CCObject (a CCNode is a CCObject, right?), and then the whole object
can be sent to the callback (THIS will not work because *sender is the Sprite, not the SpriteContainer)

TODO:
-add speed and spawnInterval to plist for each lane.  interval and speed can be RANDOM.
-different plist for each level?
-Modify pList so that each lane also specifies the types of vehicles that can spawn
-clean up traffic spawning
-add vehicles to CCArray instead of vector?
-fix bug that occurs when a chicken dies while riding a log (by hitting side of screen)
-sometimes the chicken gets stuck when on the log.  Whattup with that?
-put alligators in the water
-add a chicken count...game over if reach 0
-make dimensions easier to reference
-try out stuff on various screen sizes
-new levels mean more traffic and more eggs
-scale vehicle sprites better
-the _currentPosition section in Chicken is causing problems.  It needs to get updated along with the sprite's position.
	-the only reason it exists currently is so I can update the position with the moveUp(), moveLeft(), etc functions BEFORE running the animation.
	-instead....it would be better if the moveUp(), moveLeft(), etc functions actually ran the animations, rather than the game layer.
	-or...maybe Chicken should extend CCSprite

EVENTUALLY:
-make more level maps....some with stuff to jump onto

TODO BUGS:


FIXED BUGS:
-fix the bug where if an egg is at the left side of the screen, the chicken dies
-sometimes the cars are flipped the wrong way
